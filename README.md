My main response is in the: TakeHomeAssignment (Mechanical Intern Rob Bergbaum) file.This repository outlines my initial engineering plan for Helogen’s protein crystallization satellite test campaign. 
It’s meant as a first-pass framework to drive further team discussion, highlight system trade-offs, and propose a feasible approach given mission constraints. I decided to go more of the Systems Engineering route when making this, I did write some code which I reference in the overall response. Looking forward to hearing back from you guys -Rob
